# PROJECT 1: Sales Analysis for Company X.
__Files__: _Sales_Data_ & _Sales-Analysis.ipynb._

## Background Information:
In this project, we'll analyse hundreds of thousands of 'Electronics Store' purchases, broken down by month, product type, cost, purchase address, etc. Moreover, we'll use **Pandas** and **Matplotlib** to extract and Analyse the information, Visualise it, and answer (**5**) high-level _Business_ questions related to our Data.

- **Q1**: What was the (best) Month for Sales? How much was (earned) in that Month?
- **Q2**: What City sold the (most) Products?
- **Q3**: What (time) should we display Advertisemens to (Maximise) the likelihood of Customerâ€™s buying Products?
- **Q4**: Which Products are (most oftenly) sold (together)?
- **Q5**: What Product sold the (most)? Why do you think it sold the most?


To answer these questions, we walk through **many** different Pandas & Matplotlib **methods**. These include:
- Concatenating **multiple** CSVs together to create a NEW DataFrame (pd.concat).
- Augmenting Data to create NEW Columns.
- Using the .apply() .filter() and .transform() methods.
- Using groupby() to **Aggregate** Statistics.
- Plotting '_Bar Charts_' and '_Line Graphs_' to visualise our results.
- Labeling and **Styling** our Graphs.
